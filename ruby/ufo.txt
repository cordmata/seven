On June 24, 1947, while flying near Mt. Rainer, Arnold claimed to have
seen nine unusual objects flying in the skies. He also claimed to have
seen UFOs on several other occasions afterwards, as well.

Arnold originally described the objects' shape as "flat like a pie pan",
"shaped like a pie plate", "half-moon shaped, oval in front and convex in
the rear", "something like a pie plate that was cut in half with a sort of
a convex triangle in the rear", or simply "saucer-like" or "like a big flat
disk" (see quotes), and also described their erratic motion being "like a
fish flipping in the sun" or a saucer skipped across water. From these, the
press quickly coined the new terms "flying saucer" and "flying disc" to
describe such objects, many of which were reported within days after Arnold's
sighting. Later Arnold would add that one of the objects actually resembled a
crescent or flying wing (see image).

The U.S. Air Force formally listed the Arnold case as a mirage; this is one
of many explanations that have been disputed by critics, and researchers
Jerome Clark, author of The UFO Book (1998)[5] and Ronald Story, editor of
The Encyclopedia of UFOs (1980).[6] Both argue that there has never been an
entirely persuasive conventional explanation of the Arnold sighting.

After his UFO sighting, Arnold became a minor celebrity, and for about a
decade thereafter, he was somewhat involved in interviewing other UFO
witnesses or contactees. Notably, he investigated the claims of Samuel Eaton
Thompson, one of the first contactees. Arnold wrote a book and several
magazine articles about his UFO sighting and his subsequent research.
